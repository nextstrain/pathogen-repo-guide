# Nextclade

Previously, all "official" Nextclade workflows lived in a [central GitHub repository](https://github.com/neherlab/nextclade_data_workflows).
The new standard would be to include the Nextclade workflow within the pathogen repo.

This workflow is used to create the Nextclade datasets for this pathogen.
All official Nextclade datasets are available at https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data.

## Config

The config directory contains all of the default configurations for the Nextclade workflow.

[config/defaults.yaml](config/defaults.yaml) contains all of the default configuration parameters
used for the Nextclade workflow. Use Snakemake's `--configfile`/`--config`
options to override these default values.

## Snakefile and rules

The rules directory contains separate Snakefiles (`*.smk`) as modules of the core Nextclade workflow.
The modules of the workflow are in separate files to keep the main ingest [Snakefile](Snakefile) succinct and organized.
Modules are all [included](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#includes)
in the main Snakefile in the order that they are expected to run.
