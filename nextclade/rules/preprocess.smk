"""
This part of the workflow preprocesses any data and files related to the
lineages/clades designations of the pathogen.

REQUIRED INPUTS:

    None

OUTPUTS:

    metadata    = data/metadata.tsv
    sequences   = data/sequences.fasta

    There will be many pathogen specific outputs from this part of the workflow
    due to the many ways lineages and/or clades are maintained and defined.

This part of the workflow usually includes steps to download and curate the required files.
