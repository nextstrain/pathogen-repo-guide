# CHANGELOG

We use this CHANGELOG to document breaking changes, new features, bug fixes,
and config value changes that may affect both the usage of the workflows and
the outputs of the workflows. See [the Nextstrain CLI
changelog](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/blob/master/CHANGES.md#readme)
for an example of formatting.
