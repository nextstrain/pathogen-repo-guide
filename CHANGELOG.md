# CHANGELOG

We use this CHANGELOG to document breaking changes, new features, bug fixes,
and config value changes that may affect both the usage of the workflows and
the outputs of the workflows.

If this pathogen repo includes Nextclade datasets, we will also document the
release of new datasets here.
