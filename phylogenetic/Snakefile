# The default output of the phylogenetic workflow is usually the final

# These rules are imported in the order that they are expected to run.
# Each Snakefile will have documented inputs and outputs that should be kept as
# consistent interfaces across pathogen repos. This allows us to define typical
# steps that are required for a phylogenetic workflow, but still allow pathogen
# specific customizations within each step.
# Note that only PATHOGEN level customizations should be added to these
# core steps, meaning they are custom rules necessary for all builds of the pathogen.
# If there are build specific customizations, they should be added with the
# custom_rules imported below to ensure that the core workflow is not complicated
# by build specific rules.

# Allow users to import custom rules provided via the config.
# This allows users to run custom rules that can extend or override the workflow.
# A concrete example of using custom rules is the extension of the workflow with
# rules to support the Nextstrain automation that upload files and send internal
# Slack notifications.
# For extensions, the user will have to specify the custom rule targets when
# running the workflow.
# For overrides, the custom Snakefile will have to use the `ruleorder` directive
# to allow Snakemake to handle ambiguous rules
