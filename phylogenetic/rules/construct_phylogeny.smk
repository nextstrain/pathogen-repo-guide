This part of the workflow constructs the phylogenetic tree.

This part of the workflow expects a single aligned FASTA file.
If constructing a time-resolved tree, it will also require a metadata file
that includes a sample date for each sequence.

This will produce a Newick tree and a branch lengths JSON file.
