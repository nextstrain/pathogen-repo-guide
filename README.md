# Pathogen Repo Guide

> [!TIP]
> Follow the Nextstrain tutorial series for [Creating a pathogen repository][]
> to use the pathogen repo guide as the starting point for a new pathogen repository.


This is a Nextstrain pathogen repository guide for setting up a pathogen
repo to hold the files necessary to run and maintain a Nextstrain pathogen build.

Using this guide will allow you to start with the general repository
and workflow organization that is expected of a Nextstrain maintained pathogen.
However, the workflows will require customizations to support your specific pathogen
and should not be expected to "just work".
