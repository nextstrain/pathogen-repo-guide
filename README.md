# Pathogen Repo Template

This is a Nextstrain pathogen repository template for setting up a pathogen
repo to hold the files necessary to run and maintain a Nextstrain pathogen build.

Using this template will allow you to start with the general repository
and workflow organization that is expected of a Nextstrain maintained pathogen.
However, the workflows will require customizations to support your specific pathogen
and should not be expected to "just work".
