# Ingest

This workflow ingests public data from NCBI and outputs curated metadata and
sequences that can be used as input for the phylogenetic workflow.

If you have another data source or private data that needs to be formatted for
the phylogenetic workflow, then you can use a similar workflow to curate your
own data.
